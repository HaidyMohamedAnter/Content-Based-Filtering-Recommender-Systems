# Content-Based Recommender System

Hey there! 👋 This project is all about building a smart **Content-Based Recommendation System** — the kind that suggests movies, books, articles, or whatever *based on what you actually like*. No need to rely on other users. Just your tastes, your vibes.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

✅ Cleans and preps your content  
✅ Builds user profiles from their interactions  
✅ Calculates item similarity (so we know what’s "like what")  
✅ Recommends content that actually makes sense  
✅ Visualizes everything to make it all feel real

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

Ready to roll? Here’s how to get started:

1. **Clone or unzip** this project.
2. Create a fresh virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Fire up Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🧠 How to Use

1. Start with `data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean things up.  
2. Move on to `content_similarity.ipynb` to see what’s similar.  
3. Use `user_profile_construction.ipynb` to understand user preferences.  
4. Then hit `ranking_and_recommendation.ipynb` to get those sweet recs.  
5. Finally, open `Visualizations.ipynb` to *see* what’s going on.

## 💡 Results

You’ll end up with **personalized recommendations** based on what a user has liked or interacted with. And we give you nice visual breakdowns too, because data should look good.
